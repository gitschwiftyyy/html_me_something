    <p>
      Since I was young, I have always loved camping. I have lived in the city my whole life, and while I enjoy an urban atmosphere, it can get stifling. Camping is a way for me to escape the fast-paced life and return to nature. I have traveled to a number of places in my camping trips, but few compare to wilderness camping.

    <h2>What is wilderness camping?</h2>
    <p>
      Wilderness camping, or high adventure camping, is a program in which a crew completes a trek through wilderness areas, usually for more than a week at a time. On these treks, the crew is mostly or entirely cut off from base camp or the outfitter in charge of dispatching crews. It involves physical and survival training, planning an itinerary, and preparing the proper equipment and supplies to complete the journey. Here is an overview of the wilderness camping lands I have visited. All of these areas are owned and operated by the Boy Scouts.
